# Timing Your Presentation

- Sometimes it is handy to know just how much time you have to
  left to finish your presentation
- To get this feature, add the following markup to the
  content of the head element, replacing 5 by the duration
  of your presentation in minutes
      <meta name="duration" content="5" />
- The time left in minutes and seconds is shown in the footer
  next to the slide number
- The clock starts to run when you move away from the first slide
- Moving back to the first slide pauses the clock
